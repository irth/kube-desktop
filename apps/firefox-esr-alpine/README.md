# firefox-esr-on-kube

This is an early version of firefox working inside your kube on your Linux desktop distro.

## What works

Well... it starts... fonts are all messed up, but you can open up pages and so on.

## What's not working

- [ ] Sound - I don't know how to do docker's **--device** flag on kube
- [ ] whole lot of DBUS - just... not there yet
- [ ] fonts are messed up

Have fun! and port more apps pls
